//OOPs Concepts
  //There are 6 concepts in oops
    //Class
    //Object
    //Abstraction---
    //Inheritance       These 4 are know as pillars
    //Encapsulation   
    //Polymorphism---

  //Class
    //Class is a collection of data members and member functions
    //Data members are the properties of the class
    //member functions are the actions of the class

  //Object
    //Object is a instance of a class.

  //Abstraction: This involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object.

  //Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the method wrap the code to a bundle form. data members and member functions are wrapped into one single code.

  //Inheritance: create class from the existing class and that new class have all the ability of the existing class.

  //Polymorphism: Ability to take more than one form.
   //Ex:The function have more ability to do several works.
